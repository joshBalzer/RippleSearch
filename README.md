# RippleSearch
I have implemented a new search algorithm for unsorted data that I am calling Ripple search. Ripple search starts in the middle of the data and works its way towards both ends at an equal pace. There is a benefit of using ripple search rather than linear search as the data that is being searched for is usually closer to the center than the edges.
